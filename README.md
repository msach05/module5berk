# Summary and Conclusion

Customers who are most likely to accept coupons are young (under 31), single individuals without children, traveling to non-urgent destinations with friends, during sunny weather and higher temperatures (above 70Â°F). They tend to prefer coupons for carryout, takeaway, or affordable restaurants (under 20 dollar) and are more responsive to coupons with a 1-day expiration. Acceptance rates are also higher during meal-related times such as 10 AM, 2 PM, and 6 PM. Income levels show higher acceptance among those earning less than $62,499 or over $100,000, while gender and bar visits do not significantly impact acceptance.
